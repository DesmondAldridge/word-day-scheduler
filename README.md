## <u>REFLECTIONS</u>

#### My commit comments detail my process, mostly a series of troubleshooting, learning, and relearning from all aspects of coding from logic, available methods, general syntax, scope, etc. 

#### In this assignment in particular a lot of solutions at first <marquee height="17" width="30">alluded</marquee> me, but obvously that in itself provides A LOT of learning opportunities (both in discovering new aspects and tools to approach and tackle common issues at hand as well as simply reinforcing what was learned in class). I thoroughly enjoy this assignment.
